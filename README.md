# Activity Stalker (final app name pending)
Simple app that gets nosy and what you do everyday in life and poops out a chart of some sorts based your activity. I know the name is kinda weird; haven't thought much about it. Thinking of Wyd (the "what you doing" slang) but haven't checked if it's taken :D
